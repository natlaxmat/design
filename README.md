# ✔️ design

Test design techniques are used to systematize testing, reduce testing time, and identify the maximum number of defects before release.
The online store [demoshopping.ru](https://demoshopping.ru/) study project has several modules such as Registration and Authorization, Catalog, Payment. 
One of my tasks during the study was to test those modules using some test design techniques.

_Test design techniques that I used to test the modules:_


- [Equivalence classes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HyOugt21-IhXJQqHKkiX8xKkHFRddjkhUHcw8yN764Q/edit?usp=sharing) for the Registration form testing

- [Pairwise](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hxK1matCWI3M7jupD0llihaK__SjlT1H8BuXDANX-Wk/edit?usp=sharing) for Filtering and Sorting testing 

- [Decision table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DYrH4P_iFgTtc2bddstBS4YQtvWd930LIHmZGVFFc4A/edit?usp=sharing) for the Paypal payment module testing
